WURFL Python developers are:

    - Carlos Abalde <carlos.abalde@gmail.com>

WURFL Python implementation intentionally mimics WURFL PHP impementation
by ScientiaMobile, Inc (see extras/wurfl-php) to ease maintenance of future
releases.

Some good ideas and inspiration have been taken from pywurfl
(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pywurfl/) by Armand Lynch. Thank you!
